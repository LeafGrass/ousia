=================================================
            COPYRIGHT (C) LEAFGRASS


Introduction
------------
* Ousia is picked from Greek.
* Mainly intend to represent the essence of and operating system core.
* Developed following KISS principle.
* Use it anywhere/anyway as you wish!


Source Tree Architecture
------------------------
* core/
    Ousia core routines.

* doc/
    Complete documentation of Ousia.

* driver/
    Different kinds of device drivers based on Ousia.
    They are all configurable.

* framework/
    Framework based on Ousia. Such as shell, vfs, etc.
    They are scalable and configurable, either.

* include/
    Header files of main routines of Ousia.

* platform/
    Chip and board specific code, e.g. low-level library.
    Ousia porting code are also placed here.

* project/
    Project source code. Include several sample project instances.

* script/
    Useful scripts used while Ousia developing.

* support/
    Basic supporting stuffs for Ousia developing and building.
    Useful template files are placed here, such as porting code template.


How to Start for Fresh New Environment
--------------------------------------
-   Install toolchain
-   Make
    For a general purpose, these steps are enough, but there are some more
    steps needs to do for each platform.

    As for stm32 on linux host, we use dfu/serial/jtag to upload firmware,
    setup like below:
-   Install Codesourcery toolchain. (e.g. arm-2011.03-42-arm-none-eabi)
-   Install dfu-util/pyserial/openocd (it's up to your preference).
    Ps: In fedora or ubuntu, yum/apt-get install them is ok.
-   Resolve usb or serial access problems.
    (e.g. copy ousia/support/dfu/45-maple.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/)
-   Install minicom for console print if you want to debug with uart.
    Ps: Default port is /dev/ttyACMx
-   Do 'make' and 'make install'.


Create User Project Steps
-------------------------
-   Create a directory named PROJECT_NAME in folder "project".
-   Add user source code.
-   Create a file rules.mk to specify source code related rules for makefile.
-   Update TARGET_PLATFORM and PROJECT_NAME in main Makefile, then make.

Ps: Refer to existing projects for further detailed information.


Core Developing Steps
---------------------
-   Choose or create a branch of yourself to work on.
-   Update source code, include those version related strings.
-   Modify related Makefiles and configuration files.
-   Build then do some testing on this branch.
-   Commit it.
-   Tag a new one if a new version is commited.
-   Push this branch to remote repo.
-   If this is a release version, update Ousia Release Notes.


Porting Steps
-------------
-   Create a directory named PLATFORM_NAME in folder "platform", then enter it.
-   Create three files: rules.mk config.mk target.mk.
        @rules.mk: makefile source code related rules
        @config.mk: parameters or flags for toolchains and environment
        @target.mk: rules for building target
-   Create a directory named "port" there then create three files in it.
        @ousia_cfg.h: os scalability related configurations
        @ousia_port.h: header of porting code
        @ousia_port.c: implentation of porting
-   Create other porting related stuffs, such as linker scripts, if necessary.
-   Update TARGET_PLATFORM and PROJECT_NAME in main Makefile, then make.

Ps: If modified porting related code, should not edit directly in "core/port",
do that in specific platform directory instead, e.g. "platform/stm32/port".
Makefile will copy them into "core/port" automatically depend on specific cpu
types.


Build A Different Platform
--------------------------
Only modify the header TODO in root Makefile
-   Assign specific TARGET_PLATFORM and PROJECT_NAME


Download Code to Target Chip
----------------------------
-   Modify related User Customization Items in Makefile in source tree.
    For stm32, you need to decide which MEMORY_TARGET to use:
    jtag, flash, or ram.
-   Do proper operation on hardware. (i.e. change boot jumper or reset or sth.)
-   Then type 'make install' and it will do everything for you.

Ps: For stm32, there may be a bootloader, 'make bootloader' will download
bootloader code to chip via serial. And for simulation on x86, no code
downloading procedure is needed. See Makefile for detailed information.
